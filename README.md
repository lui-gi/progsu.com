## Contributing

We welcome contributions from all club members, regardless of technical experience. There are multiple ways to contribute to the website, from content updates to code improvements.

### For Non-Technical Contributors

#### Content Management with Sanity CMS

Our website uses Sanity CMS for managing events, announcements, and other dynamic content. This allows non-technical members to update website content without touching code.

**Getting Access:**
1. Contact a club officer on Discord or at club meetings
2. Request access to the Sanity CMS workspace
3. You'll receive an invitation to join the progsuSite project

**Using Sanity Studio:**
1. Navigate to the studio directory: `cd studio`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the CMS interface: `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3333` in your browser
5. Sign in with your Google or GitHub account

**Content Types Available:**
- **Events**: Create workshop announcements, meeting notices, and social events
- **Tags**: Organize content by topics like "Web Development," "AI/ML," or "Beginner-Friendly"

**Adding Events:**
1. Click "Events" in the Sanity Studio sidebar
2. Click "Create new Event"
3. Fill in the required fields (title, description, date)
4. Add optional information (location, registration links, images)
5. Set appropriate tags for categorization
6. Click "Publish" when ready

**Content Guidelines:**
- Use clear, descriptive titles that indicate the event type and target audience
- Include specific dates, times, and locations when available
- Write engaging descriptions that explain what attendees will learn or experience
- Add relevant tags to help users find content
- Include images when possible to make events more appealing
- Proofread content before publishing

#### Editing Static Data Files

Some content is managed through TypeScript files that can be edited directly. These files are well-documented and designed for easy editing by non-technical members.

##### Member Directory (src/data/members.ts)

This file contains information about all club members, organized by academic year.

**Adding New Members:**
1. Open `src/data/members.ts`
2. Find the appropriate academic year section (e.g., "2025-2027")
3. Copy an existing member object and modify it:

```typescript
{
  name: "Your Name",
  role: "Member",  // or "Vice President", "Secretary", etc.
  description: "Brief description of your interests and contributions",
  github: "your-github-username",  // Optional, only if you have one
  linkedin: "your-linkedin-profile",  // Optional
  specialties: ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"]  // Optional skills list
}
```

4. Save the file and the website will update automatically

**Adding New Academic Years:**
Add a new section to the `membersByYear` object:

```typescript
"2027-2029": [
  // Add member objects here
]
```

**Special Roles:**
- Presidents receive special visual effects (golden sparkles)
- "Founding President" receives ultra-special effects (violet sparkles)
- "Founding Member" and "Founding Academic Advisor" get priority placement

##### Club History (src/data/clubHistory.ts)

This file contains the club's historical timeline displayed on the `/history` page.

**Adding Timeline Events:**
1. Open `src/data/clubHistory.ts`
2. Find the appropriate timeline section:
   - `founding`: March 2020 - Spring 2021
   - `earlyDevelopment`: 2021-2023
   - `growth`: 2023-2025
   - `currentEra`: 2025+

3. Add new events using this structure:

```typescript
{
  date: "Fall 2025",  // Can be specific date or general period
  title: "Creative Event Title",
  description: "Brief 1-2 sentence description of what happened.",
  type: "milestone"  // "milestone", "achievement", or "partnership"
}
```

**Event Types:**
- **milestone**: Major club achievements or organizational changes
- **achievement**: Specific accomplishments or recognitions
- **partnership**: New collaborations with other organizations

3. **Testing**: Changes are tested across different devices and browsers
4. **Documentation**: New features must include appropriate documentation

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to Vercel when changes are pushed to the main branch. Pull requests generate preview deployments for testing.

**Manual Deployment:**
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Vercel: `vercel --prod` (requires Vercel CLI)

**Environment Requirements:**
- Node.js 18+
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

## Site Configuration

Key configuration files:

- **src/consts.ts**: Site title, description, navigation links, and social media links
